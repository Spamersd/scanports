A simple port scanner
In the `IN.txt` file, you need to write scanned addresses in the following format:
```
192.168.0.0/24 - Subnet
192.168.1.24-192.168.1.44 - IP range
192.168.2.3
192.168.2.5
192.168.2.8
192.168.2.9 - or ip Adresses
```
the `ports.txt` file specifies the ports to scan each port on a new line, or a range of ports
80
443
1000-1200
